# CP1404 Practicals of Nicola Culik

## About Prac
This repository includes all practical works we have to complete every week for the module CP1404 in order to complete it.
Every practical is about the things we learned in the respective week. This way we learn how to apply programming patterns.

## About me
I am Nicola from Switzerland. I am here at JCU to advance my career further and to get to know some other practices. 
Also to get to know some more cultures.

## What I learned
- Don't repeat yourself: Write code only once and structure it simply
- Function design: Should only do one thing
- Error checking: This way program or user errors can be handled
